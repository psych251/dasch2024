## Introduction

Within social movement scholarship, a radical flank effect (RFE) is the influence of activists with more extreme ideologies and tactics on a movement, particularly on how the public perceives it. Evidence is mixed as to whether the presence of radical flanks increases or decreases public support. Dasch et al. (2024) used an experimental approach to clarify this relationship, and found across two studies that radical flanks can increase support for moderate groups and decrease support for radical ones. I plan to replicate the first study to further test the effect of radical flanks on support for moderate groups, and confirm their other findings. This project complements my prior research on the effects of collective action tactics but takes a more psychological rather than sociological approach.

Dasch et al. (2024) provide an [online supplement](https://osf.io/z5d4s/), which contains thorough documentation of their procedures, Qualtrics surveys, data, and code. Additionally, they [pre-registered their study](https://osf.io/z5d4s/registrations). All of these factors increase the likelihood of successful replication.

To replicate experiment 1, I will recruit around 130 participants through Prolific. These participants will be given a Qualtrics survey, where they will read a fake news story about two activist groups protesting and then answer questions. Participants will be randomly assigned to either a nonviolent or radical flank version of the story. The primary outcome measures will be support for the moderates group.

## Methods

### Power Analysis

The effect size for the main effect of reading about a violent flank group and to a non-violent main group compared to two peaceful groups was $d=0.50$ in the first study. To achieve 80% power to detect this effect, I would need 128 participants in total (172 participants for 90% power and 210 participants for 95% power).

### Planned Sample

Given budgetary constraints, I will use a recruit a sample of 130 participants. In line with the original study, I will restrict my sample to UK residents.

### Materials

Dasch et al. (2024) provide the following overview of their materials:

> After the participants consented to the online survey, they were randomly allocated into one of the three conditions: *nonviolent condition*, *radical flank condition*, or *violent condition*. In each condition, the participants were introduced to the key issue: the concerns of some surrounding the environmental impact of consuming animal products. Next, they each read a fictitious newspaper article which described a social movement protesting against a (fictional) university’s decision to reduce the number of green food products at catered events. After briefly being introduced to the conflict at hand, the participants read short descriptions about the protest actions of two university-based groups, *main group* (*PlanetVeg*) and *flank group* (*SuperGreens*).
>
> In the nonviolent condition ... protesters in the *nonviolent main group* held a peaceful demonstration and sent an email to staff and students at the university, and protesters in *the nonviolent flank group* organized a peaceful demonstration and distributed a petition to staff and students. On the other hand, in the violent condition ... the *violent main group* held a forceful demonstration and occupied the University canteen to verbally and physically harass anyone who was eating meat. This caused one person who was in the canteen at the time to take some time away from the university. Further, the *violent flank group* organized a demonstration and distributed a petition. They verbally and physically harassed anyone who showed a lack of interest in the petition, and the demonstration injured a security guard. Finally, in the radical flank condition ... the *main group* was nonviolent (*PlanetVeg*) and the *flank group* was violent (*SuperGreens*). The description of the *nonviolent main group* was identical to the text describing their behaviors in the nonviolent condition, and the description of the *violent flank group* was identical to the text describing their behaviors in the violent condition.

I will use the same materials. However, I will only use two of the conditions—the nonviolent main and flank group condition and the nonviolent main and violent flank group condition—to maximize power.

### Procedure

I will follow Dasch et al.'s (2024) procedure:

> Following the article and the reading comprehension checks, participants answered several questions about their perceptions of ... the two groups separately. Furthermore, participants completed measures about their general attitudes ... and a demographic survey.

### Analysis Plan

I will use the following measures reported by Dasch et al. (2024):

**Manipulation Checks**

> We measured perceived extremity by asking participants to rate their perception of radicality and violence of the social movements (e.g., “PlanetVeg are radical/violent”).

**Identification With the Protesters**

> Participants rated their agreement with these three statements for the *main group* ... and the *flank group* ... separately.

**Support for the Movement**

> We measured the support for ... the two subgroups with four items each (e.g., “I would participate in a protest of PlanetVeg”).

**Sympathy for the Movement’s Cause**

> We operationalized sympathy for the movement’s cause with four items from the New Environmental Paradigm scale ([Dunlap et al., 2000](https://gep.psychopen.eu/index.php/gep/article/download/11121/11121.html?inline=1#r13)). The identical four items ... have already been used in [Schmitt and colleagues (2019)](https://gep.psychopen.eu/index.php/gep/article/download/11121/11121.html?inline=1#r38) (e.g., “Over-consumption is posing a serious risk to humankind and life on planet earth”).

**Demographic Questionnaire**

> Participants completed a demographic survey including items about age, gender, political ideology, and current or achieved level of education.

Like Dasch et al. (2024), I will exclude participants who spend less than 15 seconds on the treatment or who report that they do not consent to the study. I will also drop participants who do not answer the key survey questions.

I will compute Cohen's d to test if support for the main group systematically varies across conditions. I will similarly test if identification with the main group varies across conditions. As a secondary analysis, I will test whether identification mediates the relationship between condition and support for the main group.

### Differences from Original Study

-   I am dropping the violent main group violent flank condition.

-   I am dropping the Instructional Manipulation Checks in favor of a comprehension check.

-   I have adjusted formatting of news articles to align with the Study 2 articles because I couldn't find a picture of what Dasch et al.'s (2024) Study 1 articles looked like.

### Methods Addendum (Post Data Collection)

You can comment this section out prior to final report with data collection.

#### Actual Sample

Sample size, demographics, data exclusions based on rules spelled out in analysis plan

#### Differences from pre-data collection methods plan

Any differences from what was described as the original plan, or “none”.

## Results

### Data preparation

Data preparation following the analysis plan.

### Confirmatory analysis

The analyses as specified in the analysis plan.

*Side-by-side graph with original graph is ideal here*

### Exploratory analyses

Any follow-up analyses desired (not required).

## Discussion

### Summary of Replication Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the confirmatory analysis and the assessment of whether it replicated, partially replicated, or failed to replicate the original result.

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis, (b) assessment of the meaning of the replication (or not) - e.g., for a failure to replicate, are the differences between original and present study ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the replication attempt. None of these need to be long.
