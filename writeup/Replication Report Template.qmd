## Introduction

Within social movement scholarship, a radical flank effect (RFE) is the influence of activists with more extreme ideologies and tactics on a movement, particularly on how the public perceives it. Evidence is mixed as to whether the presence of radical flanks increases or decreases public support. Dasch et al. (2024) used an experimental approach to clarify this relationship, and found across two studies in the UK and US that radical flanks can increase support for moderate groups and decrease support for radical ones. However, in the US study, the increase in support for moderates did not reach the level of statistical significance. Dasch et al. (2024, p. 24) speculate that the "lack of significance may be due to insufficient statistical power," and not a fundamental difference between the US and UK contexts. I plan to replicate the US study to further test the effect of radical flanks on support for moderate groups in the US, and confirm their other findings.

Dasch et al. (2024) provide an [online supplement](https://osf.io/z5d4s/), which contains thorough documentation of their procedures, Qualtrics surveys, data, and code. Additionally, they [pre-registered their study](https://osf.io/z5d4s/registrations). All of these factors increase the likelihood of successful replication.

To replicate experiment 2, I will recruit around 500 participants through Prolific. These participants will be given a Qualtrics survey, where they will read a fake news story about two activist groups protesting and then answer questions. Participants will be randomly assigned to either a nonviolent, violent, or radical flank version of the story. The primary outcome measures will be support for moderates and radicals. Given Dasch et al.'s (2024) concern about statistical power, a challenge will be to recruit a sufficient number of participants, as my budget is limited.

[Original Paper](https://github.com/psych251/dasch2024/blob/main/original_paper/11121-Article%20Text-119987-2-10-20240429.pdf).

\[No abstract is needed.\] Each replication project will have a straightforward, no frills report of the study and results. These reports will be publicly available as supplementary material for the aggregate report(s) of the project as a whole. Also, to maximize project integrity, the intro and methods will be written and critiqued in advance of data collection. Introductions can be just 1-2 paragraphs clarifying the main idea of the original study, the target finding for replication, and any other essential information. It will NOT have a literature review -- that is in the original publication. You can write both the introduction and the methods in past tense.


## Methods

### Power Analysis

Original effect size, power analysis for samples to achieve 80%, 90%, 95% power to detect that effect size.  Considerations of feasibility for selecting planned sample size.

### Planned Sample

Planned sample size and/or termination rule, sampling frame, known demographics if any, preselection rules if any.

### Materials

All materials - can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.

### Procedure	

Can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.

### Analysis Plan

Can also quote directly, though it is less often spelled out effectively for an analysis strategy section.  The key is to report an analysis strategy that is as close to the original - data cleaning rules, data exclusion rules, covariates, etc. - as possible.  

**Clarify key analysis of interest here**  You can also pre-specify additional analyses you plan to do.

### Differences from Original Study

Explicitly describe known differences in sample, setting, procedure, and analysis plan from original study.  The goal, of course, is to minimize those differences, but differences will inevitably occur.  Also, note whether such differences are anticipated to make a difference based on claims in the original article or subsequent published research on the conditions for obtaining the effect.

### Methods Addendum (Post Data Collection)

You can comment this section out prior to final report with data collection.

#### Actual Sample
  Sample size, demographics, data exclusions based on rules spelled out in analysis plan

#### Differences from pre-data collection methods plan
  Any differences from what was described as the original plan, or “none”.


## Results


### Data preparation

Data preparation following the analysis plan.
	
```{r include=F}
### Data Preparation

#### Load Relevant Libraries and Functions

#### Import data

#### Data exclusion / filtering

#### Prepare data for analysis - create columns etc.
```

### Confirmatory analysis

The analyses as specified in the analysis plan.  

*Side-by-side graph with original graph is ideal here*

### Exploratory analyses

Any follow-up analyses desired (not required).  

## Discussion

### Summary of Replication Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the confirmatory analysis and the assessment of whether it replicated, partially replicated, or failed to replicate the original result.  

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis, (b) assessment of the meaning of the replication (or not) - e.g., for a failure to replicate, are the differences between original and present study ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the replication attempt.  None of these need to be long.
